# mini-apis
API server for my small web-dev projects!

This API server serves API routes for the following projects:
- Quotemaster - A simple API for people to share interesting quotes! Used primarily as a tool for learning frontend JavaScript frameworks - see [quotemaster-vue](https://github.com/max8539/quotemaster-vue) and quotemaster-react (coming soon).
